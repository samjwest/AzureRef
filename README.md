Azure Reference Diagrams created with PlantUML

Microsoft has provided a set of [reference architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/)  for Azure which often include **Visio** diagrams. This repository contains a growing collection of **[PlantUml](http://plantuml.com/)** implementations of those same diagrams. I am making them available free to use as you see fit. I'll set up the proper license info soon.
